# Device type selector and the type icon components
This folder contains the `DeviceTypeSelector` and `DeviceTypeIcon` components,
which are used to select and display types in the application.

The `DeviceTypeSelector` component allows users to select a type from a list, while the `DeviceTypeIcon` component displays the selected type.

Types are used from [`type-detector`](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.type-detector).
