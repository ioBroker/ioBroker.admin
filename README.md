User interface for configuration and administration of ioBroker.

**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.** For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.

## JSON config schema

The JSON config schema description can be found at [JSON config schema](/packages/jsonConfig/SCHEMA.md).

## Using common.localLink

-   `%ip%` - ioBroker ip address (address of the admin)
-   `%secure%` or `%protocol%` - read from `native.secure` the value and use http or https
-   `%web_protocol%` - looking for the first instance of web (e.g., `web.0`) and get `native.secure` from `system.adapter.web.0`
-   `%instance%` - instance of the adapter
-   `%someField%` - get someField from `native` of this adapter instance
-   `%web.0_bind%` - get `native.bind` from `system.adapter.web.0`
-   `%native_someField%` - get someField from `native` of this adapter instance

## Scheduled restart

Some adapters are not stable or connection disappears after one or two days.
To fix this, there is a scheduled restart setting.
To activate scheduled restart, just define CRON condition when to restart adapter.

It is suggested to restart in the night, when no one use the adapter, e.g. `0 3 * * *` - at 3:00 every day.

## Let's Encrypt Certificates

To manage and update, let's encrypt certificates you need to use [`iobroker.acme`](https://github.com/iobroker-community-adapters/ioBroker.acme) adapter.

You will have so-called "collections" of certificates. Each collection has its own domains.
You can select in configuration of admin adapter if and which collection to use.

## Simple instance's settings page

The user has the possibility to limit the access to the instance configuration dialog.
For that, the option "Allow access only to specific instances" must be activated.
It could be found on the "Access to the instances" tab.
Additionally, the allowed instances should be selected in the appeared configuration table.

If this option is disabled, the simple configuration page could be accessed under `http://IP:8081/configs.html`

## Reverse proxy

Please be sure that you forward not only the http/https requests, but the web-socket traffic too. It is essential for communication.

From version 6.1.0 you have the possibility to tune intro page for usage with reverse proxy.

### Example

Your `ioBroker.admin` runs on port 8081 behind reverse proxy with domain `iobroker.mydomain.com` under path `/ioBrokerAdmin/`.
And you set up e.g., nginx to forward the requests to the `http://local-iobroker.IP:8081`.

The same is with your web instance: `https://iobroker.mydomain.com/ioBrokerWeb/ => http://local-iobroker.IP:8082`.
And with rest-api instance: `https://iobroker.mydomain.com/ioBrokerAPI/ => http://local-iobroker.IP:8093`.

You can add the following lines into Reverse Proxy tab to let Intro tab run behind reverse proxy properly:

| Global path       | Instance      | Instance path behind proxy |
|-------------------|---------------|----------------------------|
| `/ioBrokerAdmin/` | `web.0`       | `/ioBrokerWeb/`            |
|                   | `rest-api.0`  | `/ioBrokerAPI/`            |
|                   | `admin.0`     | `/ioBrokerAdmin/`          |
|                   | `eventlist.0` | `/ioBrokerWeb/eventlist/`  |

So all links of instances that use web server, like `eventlist`, `vis`, `material` and so on will use `https://iobroker.mydomain.com/ioBrokerWeb/` path
